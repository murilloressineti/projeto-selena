            It's been said and done<br>
            Every beautiful thought's been already sung<br>
            And I guess right now, here's another one<br>
            So your melody will play on and on with the best of 'em<br><br>

            You're beautiful like a dream come alive, incredible<br>
            A centerfold miracle, lyrical<br>
            You've saved my life again<br>
            And I want you to know baby<br><br>

            I, I love you like a love song baby<br>
            I, I love you like a love song baby<br>
            I, I love you like a love song baby<br>
            And I keep hittin re-pe-pe-peat<br><br>

            I, I love you like a love song baby<br>
            I, I love you like a love song baby<br>
            I, I love you like a love song baby<br>
            And I keep hittin re-pe-pe-peat<br><br>

            Constantly, boy you played through<br> 
            My mind like a symphony<br>
            There's no way to describe what you do to me<br>
            You just do to me what you do<br>
            And it feels like I've been rescued<br><br>

            I've been set free<br>
            I'm hypnotized by your destiny<br>
            You're magical, lyrical, beautiful, you are<br>
            I want you to know baby<br><br>

            I, I love you like a love song baby<br>
            I, I love you like a love song baby<br>
            I, I love you like a love song baby<br>
            And I keep hittin re-pe-pe-peat<br><br>

            I, I love you like a love song baby<br>
            I, I love you like a love song baby<br>
            I, I love you like a love song baby<br>
            And I keep hittin re-pe-pe-peat<br><br>

            No one compares<br>
            You stand alone<br>
            To every record I own<br>
            Music to my heart<br>
            That's what you're<br>
            A song that goes on and on<br><br>

            I, I love you like a love song baby<br>
            I, I love you like a love song baby<br>
            I, I love you like a love song baby<br>
            And I keep hittin re-pe-pe-peat<br><br>

            I, I love you like a love song baby<br>
            I, I love you like a love song baby<br>
            I, I love you like a love song baby<br>
